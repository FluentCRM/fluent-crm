We also made sure  Here are some reviews from early adopters.

>__👦 Chris Lema, VP, Products at Liquid Web / Nexcess__
>...Those are all external solutions that don't run within your WordPress (or WooCommerce) site. Until now, the only native WordPress marketing automation solution I knew of was Groundhogg. But that was before I discovered FluentCRM. Not everyone can afford an external marketing automation platform or monthly fee. That's where #FluentCRM comes in.

>__👨 Review from David McCan, Founder @ WebTNG__
>FluentCRM will become the go-to email marketing solution for WordPress-based membership, course, and eCommerce sites.
 FluentCFM simplifies the complexity of email marketing and makes it available from within your WordPress dashboard.
 It is satisfying to be able to manage email engagement from within WordPress, where everything is under my control.

>__👨 Davinder Singh Kainth, Founder, The WP Weekly__
>Finally, an email marketing solution that looks native to the WordPress user interface and is super easy to use. Ideal for beginners to quickly get started with email lead generation to advanced users wanting to set up funnels with advanced tagging. FluentCRM offers a lot from the start and promises a lot more in future iterations.

>__👦 Eric Gracieta from BrockwayProduction, WordPress Consultant__
>FluentCRM looks like a very promising WordPress-powered CRM. It has everything a beginner needs to get started and has the power to follow you along when you need more advanced features. Very advanced, yet simple, CRM without the heavy cost, it has won my heart !
