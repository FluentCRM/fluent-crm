= Build and Crafted By Ninjas =

FluentCRM is build by professional WordPress developers who are working in WordPress eco-system for more than 10 years. FluentCRM is developed by same authors of Ninja Tables and FluentForms (The fastest and Modern Form Builder Plugin). We started this project mid 2019 and after 1 year of development we released the first version by doing a month long private beta testing and using this plugin our own website for last 6 months. We also made sure  Here are some reviews from early adapters.

>__👨 Review from David McCan, Founder @ WebTNG__
>FluentCRM will become the go-to email marketing solution for WordPress based membership, course, and ecommerce sites.
 FluentCFM simplifies the complexity of email marketing and makes it available from within your WordPress dashboard.
 It is satisfying to be able to manage email engagement from within WordPress, where everything is under my control.

>__👨 Davinder Singh Kainth, Founder, The WP Weekly__
>Finally, an email marketing solution that looks native to the WordPress user interface and is super easy to use. Ideal for beginners to quickly get started with email lead generation to advanced users wanting to set up funnels with advanced tagging. FluentCRM offers a lot from the start and promises a lot more in future iterations.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Are there any limitations about how many emails I can send? =

No, there are no limitations. You can send as many emails as you want and also no limitations on contact numbers.

= How emails are sent? =

You can use any SMTP service like MailGun, SendGrid, Amazon SES. We recommend using Amazon SES because it’s a reliable and cost-effective solution.

= Is it 100% self-hosted? =

Yes, FluentCRM is 100% self-hosted. FluentCRM will not connect with any of our SAAS servers. You own the data and your data should be hosted in your hosting server.

= Is it GDPR complaint? =

Yes, your data never goes to a different server like MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, or 100s of other CRM. All the data will be saved and managed into WordPress.

= Will it be a performance issue for WordPress? =

Absolutely not! From the very first, We were careful about this. It stores all the Campaign and Contact data in custom database tables so it will not affect your WordPress database. We built the application with VueJS and it’s only run when you go to the admin dashboard of Fluent CRM. Also, The Admin UI is super fast as It’s a SPA and communicates over ajax.

= I want to report a bug, where to report? =
