**Q: Are there any limitations about how many emails I can send?**
No, there are no limitations. You can send as many emails as you want and also no limitations on contact numbers.

**Q: How emails are sent?**
You can use any SMTP service like MailGun, SendGrid, Amazon SES. We recommend using Amazon SES because it’s a reliable and cost-effective solution.

**Q: Is it 100% self-hosted?***
Yes, FluentCRM is 100% self-hosted. I will not connect with any of our SAAS servers. You own the data and your data should be hosted in your hosting server.

**Q: Is it GDPR complaint?***
Yes, your data never goes to a different server like MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, or 100s of other CRM. All the data will be saved and managed into WordPress.

**Q: Will it be a performance issue for WordPress?**
Absolutely not! From the very first, We were careful about this. It stores all the Campaign and Contact data in custom database tables so it will not affect your WordPress database. We built the application with VueJS and it’s only run when you go to the admin dashboard of Fluent CRM. Also, The Admin UI is super fast as It’s a SPA and communicates over ajax.
